Hi!

This is en example of Spring JUnit Cucumber Framework build by me for my project
with Digital Marketing agency to test application for managing builboards advertisings across the country

It's a UI framwwork with the following tech stack: using Spring, Java, JUnit5, Cucumber and Jenkins.

This framework doesn't contain real projects tests but can be use as basis for other projects.

Please use the following configurations to run your test sweat:

SET UP for JUNIT Runner to start Spring build on your local computer:
Enviroment variables = spring.profiles.active=stage,local

SET UP for Maven & JUNIT Runner to start Spring build on your Jenkins in Configure:
-e clean test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke and not @obsolete" -Dspring.profiles.active=stage,remote
